# Concept Map Expansion Log

## Overview
This log tracks the iterative expansion of the concept map, documenting decisions, rationale, and progress.

## Expansion Strategy
- Start with root concept (CSCD211)
- Add 3-7 concepts per iteration
- Focus on one logical grouping at a time
- Validate visualization after each expansion

---

## Iteration 1 - Initial Creation
**Date**: August 16, 2025  
**Added Concepts**: 7 nodes, 6 links  
**Focus**: Core CSCD211 ecosystem

### Nodes Added
1. **cscd211** (course) - Root concept, Programming Principles II
2. **cscd210** (course) - Direct prerequisite course  
3. **object-oriented-programming** (paradigm) - Core paradigm taught
4. **java-programming** (language) - Implementation language
5. **encapsulation** (concept) - Key OOP principle
6. **inheritance** (concept) - Key OOP principle  
7. **testing** (skill) - Important practical skill

### Relationships Added
- `cscd210 → cscd211` (prerequisite)
- `object-oriented-programming → cscd211` (part-of) 
- `java-programming → cscd211` (implements)
- `object-oriented-programming → encapsulation` (enables)
- `object-oriented-programming → inheritance` (enables)
- `testing → cscd211` (part-of)

### Design Decisions
- **Group Selection**: Used 5 different groups to test visual separation
- **Size Weighting**: Larger nodes for courses, medium for core concepts
- **Link Strength**: Higher strength for more important relationships
- **Level Hierarchy**: 0 for courses, 1 for major concepts, 2 for specific techniques

### Validation Results
- ✅ All IDs follow naming conventions
- ✅ All required fields present
- ✅ No circular dependencies
- ✅ Link references valid
- ✅ Groups and types match schema

### Next Iteration Candidates
1. **Data Structures** - Add arrays, linked lists, basic structures
2. **Algorithm Concepts** - Add recursion, algorithm analysis
3. **Programming Fundamentals** - Add variables, control flow from CSCD210
4. **Advanced OOP** - Add polymorphism, abstraction, interfaces

## Iteration 2 - [Planned]
**Target Date**: Next expansion  
**Proposed Focus**: Programming fundamentals from CSCD210

### Candidates for Addition
- `variables` (concept)
- `control-flow` (concept) 
- `methods` (concept)
- `debugging` (skill)
- `loops` (concept)

### Relationship Candidates
- `cscd210 → variables` (part-of)
- `variables → cscd211` (prerequisite)
- `control-flow → object-oriented-programming` (prerequisite)

---

## Schema Compliance Notes

### Naming Convention Examples
- Use kebab-case: `object-oriented-programming` ✅
- Avoid underscores: `object_oriented_programming` ❌
- Avoid acronyms: `oop` ❌ (use full name instead)
- Keep reasonable length: under 30 characters ✅

### Group Usage Patterns
- `course` - Academic courses and curricula
- `paradigm` - Programming paradigms and approaches  
- `concept` - Abstract programming concepts
- `language` - Programming languages and technologies
- `skill` - Practical abilities and techniques

### Relationship Type Usage
- `prerequisite` - Must learn source before target
- `part-of` - Source is component of target
- `implements` - Source provides implementation for target
- `enables` - Source knowledge unlocks target understanding
- `related` - General conceptual connection

---

## Quality Metrics

### Current Status
- **Nodes**: 7 total
- **Links**: 6 total  
- **Groups**: 5 different groups used
- **Levels**: 3 hierarchy levels (0-2)
- **Average Connections**: 1.7 links per node
- **Schema Compliance**: 100%

### Growth Targets
- **Phase 1** (Current): 7-15 nodes - Core CSCD211 concepts
- **Phase 2**: 15-30 nodes - Programming fundamentals
- **Phase 3**: 30-50 nodes - Data structures and algorithms
- **Phase 4**: 50+ nodes - Advanced topics and connections

## Lessons Learned

### What Works Well
- Starting with familiar root concept (CSCD211)
- Clear hierarchy with courses at level 0
- Diverse relationship types provide rich connections
- Size weighting helps emphasize importance

### Areas for Improvement
- Consider adding more granular OOP concepts
- May need intermediate concepts between levels
- Could benefit from cross-paradigm connections
- Need to plan for scalability beyond 50 nodes

### Schema Refinements
- Schema v1.0 working well for initial implementation
- May need additional relationship types as we expand
- Consider adding concept difficulty ratings
- Think about prerequisite chains and validation

## Expansion Roadmap

### Short Term (Next 2-3 Iterations)
1. Programming fundamentals from CSCD210
2. Core data structures (arrays, lists)  
3. Basic algorithms and analysis

### Medium Term (Next 5-10 Iterations)
1. Advanced OOP concepts (polymorphism, interfaces)
2. Software engineering practices
3. Mathematical foundations
4. Development tools and environment

### Long Term (Future Vision)
1. Complete CSCD211 curriculum coverage
2. Connections to other CS courses
3. Industry skills and applications
4. Cross-disciplinary connections
