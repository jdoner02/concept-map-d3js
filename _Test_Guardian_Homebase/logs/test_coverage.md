# Test Guardian Coverage Log - Concept Map Java Refactoring

## Project: CSCD211 Educational Concept Map
**Issue**: [#24](https://github.com/jdoner02/atomic-knowledge-database-system/issues/24)
**Start Date**: August 16, 2025
**Goal**: 90%+ test coverage with comprehensive TDD implementation

## Coverage Targets
- **Model Classes**: 95%+ coverage (POJOs should be fully testable)
- **Service Classes**: 90%+ coverage (business logic)
- **Controller Classes**: 80%+ coverage (integration complexity)
- **Overall Project**: 90%+ coverage

## TDD Progress Log

### Phase 1: Project Structure Setup
- [x] Created Test Guardian homebase structure
- [ ] Maven project structure with pom.xml
- [ ] Java package structure
- [ ] Initial test framework setup

### Phase 2: Model Layer (TDD Cycle)
- [ ] Concept class (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- [ ] Relationship class (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)  
- [ ] ConceptMap class (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)

### Phase 3: Service Layer (TDD Cycle)
- [ ] ConceptService class (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- [ ] ConceptMapService class (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- [ ] ValidationService class (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)

### Phase 4: Controller Layer (TDD Cycle)
- [ ] ConceptController class (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- [ ] ConceptMapController class (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)

### Phase 5: Integration & Frontend
- [ ] API integration tests
- [ ] Frontend JavaScript integration
- [ ] End-to-end functionality tests

## Current Coverage: 93.3% Line Coverage (EXCELLENT!)

### Coverage Details (from JaCoCo report)
- **Instructions**: 297/313 covered (94.9%)
- **Branches**: 35/44 covered (79.5%)
- **Lines**: 58/62 covered (93.5%)
- **Methods**: 17/17 covered (100%)
- **Complexity**: 30/36 covered (83.3%)

## Test Files Created
- ✅ **ConceptTest.java**: 10 comprehensive tests covering all major functionality
  - Constructor validation tests (null/empty parameters)
  - Equals and hashCode contract verification
  - ToString method testing
  - Getters and setters testing
  - Parametrized testing for multiple invalid inputs

- ✅ **RelationshipTest.java**: 15 comprehensive tests covering all functionality
  - Constructor validation with null parameter testing
  - Self-referential relationship prevention
  - Enum support for all relationship types
  - Equals and hashCode for complex objects
  - Immutability verification
  - Business logic testing (isRelatedTo method)

## Educational Value Additions
- ✅ Comprehensive JavaDoc documentation with educational explanations
- ✅ Design pattern examples (encapsulation, immutable objects, defensive programming)
- ✅ Exception handling demonstrations with proper validation
- ✅ Code quality examples for students (proper equals/hashCode implementation)
- ✅ TDD methodology demonstration (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- ✅ Enum usage and type safety examples
- ✅ Composition pattern demonstration

## TDD Cycle 1: Concept Class ✅ COMPLETED
1. **RED**: ✅ Wrote failing tests for Concept class (16 compilation errors)
2. **GREEN**: ✅ Implemented minimal Concept class to pass all tests
3. **REFACTOR**: ✅ Clean implementation with proper documentation

## TDD Cycle 2: Relationship & RelationshipType ✅ COMPLETED
1. **RED**: ✅ Wrote failing tests for Relationship class (42 compilation errors)
2. **GREEN**: ✅ Implemented RelationshipType enum and Relationship class
3. **REFACTOR**: ✅ Enhanced with comprehensive validation and business logic

## Issues Encountered
- Minor Maven warnings about Java 11 system modules (educational note for students about build configuration)
- All tests pass successfully, excellent coverage achieved across all classes

---
**Next Action**: Begin TDD Cycle 3 - ConceptMap class to manage collections of concepts and relationships
