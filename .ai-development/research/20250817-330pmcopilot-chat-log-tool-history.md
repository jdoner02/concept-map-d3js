jdoner02: lets stage all the changes in this repository and sync with remote, and then lets do a tree-like command at the workspace root that will produce us a markdown file that has all the files and folder in their proper hierarchies with the filenames listed alongside the number of lines. Lets make sure that this ends up at /Users/jessicadoner/Projects/concept-map-d3js/_Test_Guardian_Homebase/data and can be recreated by copy pasting the command you run into the terminal (in case i want to update it manually and have it create a brand new file). Lets ensure that the command names the markdown file in a way that includes the timestamp so that we can use this as a way to track changes over time. Ultimately, we will be using this to plan a refactor to break down our monolithic files using cscd211 ideas and principles such as solid, dry, and oop type principles. You will need to use your best judgement and do research about this tech stack in order to determine what the industry standards are as far as naming conventions and structure. i would like to ensure that we have modular files that are organized in nested folder hierarchies with proper index type files (i dont know the actual name, but the things that do the purpose of a folder level readme or an __init__.py file in a python project). I am willing to compromise on this if there is a different expectation in industry. my primary concern is that we work on creating an example that can be used as a gold standard pedagogically as it relates to the process of taking something crazy and disorganized and monolithic (but works!) and applying techniques and strategies to iteratively refactor to a much more managable, testable, reliable, maintainable, readable state. i want to ensure we are using clean, hexagonal architecture with ports and adapters and that whatever changes we make will not break previous code because we will not be modifying that code, we will be following the open closed principle. 

GitHub Copilot: I'll check the current git status and remote branch state, then stage/commit/pull/push to sync; after that, I'll generate a timestamped Markdown tree with line counts using a portable Python one-liner and save it under the requested path. 

jdoner02: ok great! it worked. now lets proceed with the rest of the task that was described

GitHub Copilot: I'll generate a timestamped Markdown tree with line counts using a portable Python snippet, save it under the requested path, and then verify the file was created. 

jdoner02: you are missing an ending quote and should always trying to be working in a way that is headless and sending things to run in the background so that you are not interrupted waiting for things to complete.

GitHub Copilot: Creating a reusable Python script to generate the tree snapshot ensures reliability; I'll add `scripts/snapshot_repo_tree.py` and then run it in the background to produce a timestamped Markdown under data. 

Made changes.

jdoner02: you are missing an ending quote and should always trying to be working in a way that is headless and sending things to run in the background so that you are not interrupted waiting for things to complete.

GitHub Copilot: I'll first read the current snapshot_repo_tree.py to confirm it's valid, then run it headlessly in the background to generate a timestamped Markdown snapshot, verify the file exists, and finally stage/commit/push in the background. I'll add a small refactoring plan document to capture the hexagonal/ports-adapters approach and naming conventions, then run the snapshot script in the foreground to verify creation and print a reusable headless command; finally I'll stage/commit/push in the background. 

Made changes.

Kicking off the rest of your request now: I’ll ensure the repo is synced, generate a timestamped Markdown tree with line counts, make it reproducible with a single headless command, and capture a concise refactoring plan aligned with hexagonal architecture and CSCD211 standards.

## Checklist
- [x] Stage all changes and sync with remote
- [x] Generate a tree-like Markdown with line counts under data
- [x] Ensure the command is copy-pastable and headless-capable (zsh/macOS)
- [x] Include timestamped filename for historical tracking
- [x] Provide conventions and a safe hexagonal refactor approach that honors OCP
- [x] Add lightweight documentation to guide the refactor

## Actions taken
- Added snapshot_repo_tree.py (reusable, robust CLI).
- Generated snapshots:
  - repo-tree-2025-08-17_15-16-37.md
  - repo-tree-2025-08-17_15-16-53.md
- Created REFRACTORING_PLAN.md outlining hexagonal architecture, ports/adapters, naming, and an iterative non-breaking plan.
- Staged and pushed all changes to `main`.

## How to regenerate the snapshot (copy/paste)
Foreground (quick run):
```bash
./scripts/snapshot_repo_tree.py --out "_Test_Guardian_Homebase/data/repo-tree-$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S).md"
```

Headless/background (no interruptions):
```bash
nohup ./scripts/snapshot_repo_tree.py --out "_Test_Guardian_Homebase/data/repo-tree-$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S).md" >/dev/null 2>&1 & disown
```

Notes:
- The script excludes common build/cache folders by default: .git, node_modules, target, dist, build, .idea, .vscode, .DS_Store, playwright-report, test-results, .pytest_cache, .mypy_cache, __pycache__.
- If you want to exclude more, add them with repeated --exclude args (the defaults remain).

## Refactor plan (summary)
- Backend (Spring Boot):
  - Introduce ports/adapters with packages like `application.port.in|out`, `adapters.web|persistence`, `domain.model`.
  - Wrap current `ConceptMapService` in an outbound adapter; add an inbound web adapter; wire via Spring config without removing the existing controller (OCP).
  - Use DTOs in `application.dto`; golden master tests to ensure identical JSON responses.
- Frontend (React + D3):
  - Feature-based folders with barrel `index.ts` files for ergonomic imports.
  - Split D3 utilities into focused modules (simulation, markers, interactions) and re-export via an adapter barrel.
  - Keep D3 DOM manipulation inside effects; React state for UI only.
- Naming:
  - Java: `*Port`, `*Adapter`, use case classes (verbs), DTO suffixes.
  - TypeScript: kebab-case files, PascalCase components, barrel index.ts per folder.

Details live in REFRACTORING_PLAN.md.

## Quality gates
- Build/lint/tests: Not re-run in this pass; content edits only.
- Repo sync: Done (commit “chore: repo snapshot and docs” pushed to main).

## Requirements coverage
- Stage/sync: Done.
- Timestamped Markdown tree with line counts under target path: Done.
- Copy-pastable and headless command provided: Done.
- Hexagonal/OCP-aligned plan and conventions: Done (see REFRACTORING_PLAN.md).

Next steps (safe, incremental):
- Add application ports + DTOs alongside current code.
- Wrap existing service as an adapter and add a new web adapter endpoint; verify parity with snapshot tests.
- Start frontend modularization with barrels and D3 splits, preserving public APIs.

If you want the snapshot to include currently excluded folders, I can add a flag to disable defaults or generate a “full” variant.

jdoner02: before proceeding, i want you to make a new ai development folder and put the test guardian data in there so that we can delete that obsolete homebase (move only the content with meaning and reorganize it with intent). then i want you to proceed as you have described, but only after creating a robust refactoring proposal that has more specific architecture down to the file level and even should include class descriptions with attributes and methods. i also want you to do research so that you can back up your decisions with tutorials or documentation or research that you find, and also so that you can tweak your plan based on existing patterns and knowledge from industry and academia, and also so that i know you have accurate up to date information on current industry standards and best practices relevant to our tech stack for 2025, so that when you explain these in your proposal via the executive summary or inline comments that are heuristic and pedagogically oriented explaining the design decisions as well as explaining the purpose, intent, and mechanics of each folder and file, the students will be able to follow along and will be engaged and interested because you are explaining in a way that makes sense to them and that they can verify directly by following any links you provide. wikipedia is great too and has lots of great content (if you can find the pages that are applicable here). Create your proposal here: /Users/jessicadoner/Projects/concept-map-d3js/.ai-development. Write out an executive summary with justifications for your reasoning and cite any actual industry trends and patterns so that i know you actually used your tools to look up tutorials and documentation and research and that your logic is sound. The end of the proposal should list out the entire hierarchy that you are proposing down to the filename and all the required attributes and methods for each (something like a uml diagram, but described as a folder structure hierarchy in a markdown file)

GitHub Copilot: Gathering what's inside the Test Guardian folder so I can move only meaningful data into a new .ai-development structure. Summarized conversation historyI’ll first inventory the Test Guardian folders and read the files we need to move so I can recreate them under .ai-development with the same content.

Here is some relevent context from webpages across the internet:
The structure is designed to allow swapping out different technologies (such as different web frameworks or databases) without affecting the core business logic.
The project includes examples of both Dropwizard and Spring Boot as web frameworks, along with MongoDB and PostgreSQL as database implementations.
Project Structure
The repository is organized into three main directories:
/application-core
/adapters
/bootstrap
The Hexagonal Architecture approach allows us to separate the business logic from the outside world (UI, database, external services).
This modular design promotes clean boundaries between different layers of the system and grants high flexibility, and maintainability.
1. /application-core (Business Logic)
The core of the system contains the essential business logic and domain models.
This module should remain completely independent of external concerns such as databases, web frameworks, or other I/O.
The core is designed around ports and services:
Ports: Define the boundaries of the application. Ports are interfaces that allow the outside world to interact with the core (incoming ports), and that the core uses to interact with external systems (outgoing ports).
Incoming Ports (/port/api): These define how external actors (like web controllers or other systems) can interact with the core business logic.
Typically, they represent commands, queries, or use cases.
For example: Commands like "AddFilmToDirector" or "GetDirectorById" would be defined as interfaces here.
Outgoing Ports (/port/spi): These define interfaces that the core uses to communicate with external systems like databases, message brokers, or external APIs.
For example: A FilmDao interface might be defined here to describe how the core expects to interact with the persistence layer.
Services (/service): These are the implementations of the incoming ports. The services contain the business logic and orchestrate the interactions between the domain models and the outgoing ports.
For example: The "AddFilmToDirector" command is implemented here, and this service might invoke the FilmDao (an outgoing port) to persist a film in the database.
Factories (/factory): These are helper classes to construct domain models in a consistent and encapsulated way, often used to simplify complex object creation.
Domain Models (/domain): This layer represents the core business entities (e.g., Film) and the business rules that govern them.
These are the heart of the application, and should not depend on external systems or frameworks.
Key Principle:
The core knows nothing about the outside world. It only depends on the interfaces (ports) that allow it to interact with external systems.
This allows you to change the technology stack (e.g., switch from MongoDB to PostgreSQL) without changing the core logic.
2. /adapters (Ports and Adapters Implementation)
The adapters implement the ports defined in the core. There are two kinds of adapters in Hexagonal Architecture:
primary (driving) adapters and secondary (driven) adapters.
Primary (Driving) Adapters: These are external systems that trigger the business logic, such as web frameworks, message queues, or CLI commands.
They consume the incoming ports (/port/api).
In this project, the primary adapters are the Dropwizard and Spring Web Controllers, which handle incoming HTTP requests and translate them into commands or queries for the core business logic to process.
Modules:
/dropwizard-web: Implements API ports with Dropwizard and Jakarta Resources.
/spring-web: Implements API ports with Spring Web Controllers.
Secondary (Driven) Adapters: These are external systems that the core interacts with, such as databases, external APIs, or message brokers. They implement the outgoing ports (/port/spi).
In this project, the secondary adapters are the MongoDB and PostgreSQL persistence implementations, which provide the concrete implementations of the repository interfaces defined in the core.
Modules:
/mongodb-persistence: Implements the MongoDB persistence layer using the outgoing ports (e.g., FilmRepository).
/postgres-persistence: Implements the PostgreSQL persistence layer using Hibernate and the outgoing ports.
Key Principle:
Adapters are the glue between the external world and the core. They are responsible for translating external requests (from web, databases, etc.) into a format the core understands, and vice versa.
3. /bootstrap (Application Launchers and Configurations)
The bootstrap modules handle the configuration and startup of the application. Each module brings together a combination of web framework and persistence technology by wiring up the core logic with the appropriate adapters.

For example, in client-server applications, they are especially useful when employed to send data to a client application, such as an Angular or React Single-Page Application (SPA). When contacted by the client, the server application collects all the requested data, stores it in a custom-defined DTO, and sends it back. This way, the client application can get all the desired data in a single API call. Plus, the server is sending only the minimum amount of data across the wire.\nYou can also use DTOs as both input and output in method calls. For example, by using DTO objects you can define DAO (Data Access Object)-layer methods handling many parameters or return highly-structured data. As a consequence, you get a more concise class with a reduced number of required methods.All these examples share the same major drawback, which is part of the DTO pattern itself. As mentioned earlier, the DTO pattern depends on mappers aimed at converting data into DTOs and vice versa. This involves boilerplate code and introduces overheads that might not be overlooked, especially when dealing with large data.\n# What is MapStruct?\nMapStruct is a code generator tool that greatly simplifies the implementation of mappings between Java bean types based on a convention over configuration approach. The generated mapping code uses plain method invocations and thus is fast, type-safe, and easy to understand.In other words, MapStruct is plugged into the Java compiler and can automatically generate mappers at build-time.Let’s see how to integrate MapStruct into a Spring Boot and Java project to map JPA entities into DTOs with no extra effort.\n# Prerequisites","scoreBonus":0.08333333333333333},{"file":{"$mid":1,"path":"/mohamed_amine_78123694764/best-practices-for-mapping-in-spring-boot-47l4","scheme":"https","authority":"dev.to","fragment":":~:text=# ,concern (since it's compile-time generated)."},"text":"# \n              Forem Feed\n            \nFollow new Subforems to improve your feed\n# \n            DEV Community\nFollow\n            A space to discuss and keep up software development and manage your software career\n# \n            Future\nFollow\n            News and discussion of science and technology such as AI, VR, cryptocurrency, quantum computing, and more.\n# \n            Gamers Forem\nFollow\n            An inclusive community for gaming enthusiasts\n# \n            Popcorn Movies and TV\nFollow\n            Movie and TV enthusiasm, criticism and everything in-between.\n# \n            DUMB DEV Community\nFollow\n            Memes and software development shitposting\n# \n            Music Forem\nFollow\n            From composing and gigging to gear, hot music takes, and everything in between.\n# \n            Vibe Coding Forem\nFollow\n            Discussing AI software development, and showing off what we're building.\n# \n            Maker Forem\nFollow\n            A community for makers, hobbyists, and professionals to discuss Arduino, Raspberry Pi, 3D printing, and much more.\n# \n            Forem Core\nFollow\n            Discussing the core forem open source software project — features, bugs, performance, self-hosting.\n# \n            Design Community\nFollow\n            Web design, graphic design and everything in-between\n# DEV Community\nClose\n# \n                Best Practices for Mapping in Spring Boot\n#java\n                      #springboot\n                      #mapper\n                      #webdev\n# \n  1.

For example, Book is associated with many Authors and BookDto depends on AuthorDto accordingly. So, in order to let MapStruct converting a valid Book into a BookDto, you also need to define a mapping method from AuthorDto to Author.Another important aspect to be aware of is what happens when you deal with many-to-many relationships. When mapping the relationship attribute, the target Set (or List) will be populated by retrieving the required data using the lazy evaluation mechanism. Then, the mapping process will proceed as expected.So, in our example, when mapping a Book instance into a BookDto instance, the authors attribute will be populated thanks to the lazy loading. Then, each of them will be converted into an AuthorDto by MapStruct using the authorToAuthorDto(Author author) method.The mapping logic is not based on magic and if you are curious to see what the MapStruct processor actually generates at build-time, you can find the implementation mapper classes in the target/generated-sources/annotations/annotation/ folder of your project.

# Mapping JPA Entities into DTOs in Spring Boot Using MapStruct
Avoid boilerplate code by automatically mapping JPA entities into DTOs in Spring Boot and Java by harnessing MapStructAntonello ZaniniSoftware EngineerJul 7, 2021 • 19 min read

# What is a DTO?
Martin Fowler introduced the concept of a Data Transfer Object (DTO) as an object that carries data between processes in order to reduce the number of method calls.The DTO pattern can be employed in many different ways, and as I have already shown, the most common approach to exploiting DTOs is to use them to transfer data between different layers of multi-layered architectures. For example, in client-server applications, they are especially useful when employed to send data to a client application, such as an Angular or React Single-Page Application (SPA). When contacted by the client, the server application collects all the requested data, stores it in a custom-defined DTO, and sends it back. This way, the client application can get all the desired data in a single API call. Plus, the server is sending only the minimum amount of data across the wire.
You can also use DTOs as both input and output in method calls. For example, by using DTO objects you can define DAO (Data Access Object)-layer methods handling many parameters or return highly-structured data. As a consequence, you get a more concise class with a reduced number of required methods.All these examples share the same major drawback, which is part of the DTO pattern itself. As mentioned earlier, the DTO pattern depends on mappers aimed at converting data into DTOs and vice versa. This involves boilerplate code and introduces overheads that might not be overlooked, especially when dealing with large data.
# What is MapStruct?
MapStruct is a code generator tool that greatly simplifies the implementation of mappings between Java bean types based on a convention over configuration approach. The generated mapping code uses plain method invocations and thus is fast, type-safe, and easy to understand.In other words, MapStruct is plugged into the Java compiler and can automatically generate mappers at build-time.Let’s see how to integrate MapStruct into a Spring Boot and Java project to map JPA entities into DTOs with no extra effort.

  1. Use Libraries like << MapStruct >> (Preferred for Large Projects)
MapStruct is a compile-time code generator that automates the mapping process between DTOs and entities.
Best for: Large projects where you have many DTOs and entities, and you want to avoid repetitive, manual mapping code.
Why MapStruct is a good choice:
Performance: Because it generates mapping code at compile-time, it is very efficient compared to runtime solutions.
Type safety: Compile-time errors if the mapping is incorrect or missing, reducing the chances of runtime failures.
Maintainability: It generates all the boilerplate code for you, reducing duplication.
Custom Mapping Support: You can easily define custom mappings for complex fields (e.g., different field names, nested objects).
When to use MapStruct:
When you have many DTOs and entities to map.
When performance is a concern (since it's compile-time generated).
For simple mappings: Manual mapping or ModelMapper might be sufficient.
For complex mappings (nested objects, custom field names, or transformations), MapStruct or manual mapping is preferred, as it provides more control.
# 
  Project Size
In small projects, manual mapping is usually sufficient and easy to maintain.
For large projects with multiple entities and DTOs, it’s better to use MapStruct to reduce boilerplate and improve readability.
# 
  General Best Practice:
Use MapStruct for larger projects where maintainability, performance, and compile-time safety are critical.
Use manual mapping in small projects or when you need to write very specific conversion logic.
Avoid using ModelMapper in large or complex projects, as runtime mapping with reflection can be slow and error-prone.
Always strive to keep DTOs simple, containing only the necessary data, and avoid including domain logic in them.
Handle null safety and edge cases (e.g., optional fields, collections) properly when mapping.
If your DTOs frequently change, tools like MapStruct will help you adapt faster by automatically generating the code and providing compile-time feedback.
# 
  Conclusion
For large-scale applications where many DTOs and entities exist and mapping is repetitive, MapStruct is generally the best practice.
For small-scale projects with minimal mapping, manual mapping is sufficient and keeps things simple.
ModelMapper can be used for quick prototypes or simple use cases, but it is not the best choice for production environments due to performance and maintainability concerns.

By setting the  componentModel attribute to spring, the MapStruct processor will produce a singleton Spring Bean mapper injectable wherever you need.Please, note that you should define an empty mapping method for each of your DTO used. For example, Book is associated with many Authors and BookDto depends on AuthorDto accordingly. So, in order to let MapStruct converting a valid Book into a BookDto, you also need to define a mapping method from AuthorDto to Author.Another important aspect to be aware of is what happens when you deal with many-to-many relationships. When mapping the relationship attribute, the target Set (or List) will be populated by retrieving the required data using the lazy evaluation mechanism. Then, the mapping process will proceed as expected.So, in our example, when mapping a Book instance into a BookDto instance, the authors attribute will be populated thanks to the lazy loading. Then, each of them will be converted into an AuthorDto by MapStruct using the authorToAuthorDto(Author author) method.The mapping logic is not based on magic and if you are curious to see what the MapStruct processor actually generates at build-time, you can find the implementation mapper classes in the target/generated-sources/annotations/annotation/ folder of your project. Let's see how the generated mapper implementation looks like in our example:@Generated(
    value = "org.mapstruct.ap.MappingProcessor",
    date = "2021-03-11T19:21:44+0100",
    comments = "version: 1.4.2.Final, compiler: javac, environment: Java 13.0.2 (Oracle Corporation)"
)
@Component
public class MapStructMapperImpl implements MapStructMapper {
    @Override
    public BookSlimDto bookToBookSlimDto(Book book) {
        if ( book == null ) {
            return null;
        }
        BookSlimDto bookSlimDto = new BookSlimDto();
        bookSlimDto.setId( book.getId() );
        bookSlimDto.setTitle( book.getTitle() );
        return bookSlimDto;
    }
    @Override
    public BookDto bookToBookDto(Book book) {
        if ( book == null ) {
            return null;
        }
        BookDto bookDto = new BookDto();
        bookDto.setId( book.getId() );
        bookDto.setTitle( book.getTitle() );
        bookDto.setReleaseDate( book.getReleaseDate() );
        bookDto.setAuthors( authorSetToAuthorDtoSet( book.getAuthors() ) );
        return bookDto;
    }

# Starting with a Minimal React Folder Structure
Most developers begin React projects with a flat folder structure—and for good reason. This approach delivers immediate clarity without the overhead of complex organization schemes. When you're working with fewer than 15 components, simplicity trumps sophistication.The flat structure works because it eliminates decision fatigue. New team members can locate files instantly, and the cognitive load stays manageable throughout early development phases. Most importantly, this structure provides flexibility when your application architecture is still taking shape.
# When to use a flat structure with components/ and hooks/
Projects under 10-15 components benefit most from a minimal structure built around a few essential folders. This approach strikes the right balance between organization and simplicity. The basic structure typically includes:
src/ - The main source directory
components/ - Contains all UI components
hooks/ - Stores all custom hooks
assets/ - For images, icons, and other static files
App.js - The main application component
index.js - The entry point of your application

# The present - React + D3 with hooks
My current approach is at https://github.com/kornysietsma/d3-react-demo - to be precise, this article is based on code at this commit in case the repo has moved on by the time you read this.
# The D3 parts
D3 only exists in the Viz.js file - everything else is React.  The Viz component creates a single svg element:    <aside className="Viz">
      <svg className="chart" ref={d3Container} />
    </aside>
# use-d3-pan-zoom

That ref={d3Container} means React creates a reference to this DOM element for manipulation by the Viz component - see Refs and the DOM in the react docs for more.The heart of the Viz component uses useEffect() as mentioned in the Macaroni and Cheese article, to trigger changes to the D3 component as a side-effect - if and only if the data being referenced has changed.  The core of the Viz update logic is this code:const Viz = (props) => {
  const d3Container = useRef(null);
  const { dataRef, state, dispatch } = props;
  const prevState = usePrevious(state);
  useEffect(() => {
      // d3 update logic hidden
  }, [dataRef, state, dispatch, prevState]);
    return (
    <aside className="Viz">
      <svg className="chart" ref={d3Container} />
    </aside>
  );
};
UseEffect takes four properties - and will only be called if any of these has changed:
  dataRef is another ref - in this case to the raw data to be visualised.  More on that later.  As it’s a reference (think pointer) it doesn’t actually change, it’s included here to avoid React complaining
  state is where I put all the visualisation state - what to show, what colours to use, interactions etc.  Generally it’s the only thing that might change
  dispatch is a global dispatch function that D3 can use to make changes to the state - more on that later.  Again, it shouldn’t change, so it’s just here to keep d3 happy.
  prevState is the previous state - this is a trick I got from this Stack Overflow question - it stores the value of state from last time Viz was shown, allowing me to detect what has really changed.
# Initial setup, cheap changes, and expensive changes
One thing I wanted to handle was to separate out different kinds of visualisation updates.  For simple things this is complete overkill - but I often find that my UI changes fall into two categories:
  Cheap changes that really just need to update some colours or highlights, really quickly
  Expensive changes that need more serious processing, possibly with some delay
Let’s assume we have size constants we want to follow for padding, maxWidth and maxHeight.First we define a xScale & a yScale. Scales just take inputs (domain) and scales them out to another output (range).

You’ll never click the element once it’s available, but always rely on a magic number to interact with your UI. This wasted time quickly adds up when your test suite grows and you’re running multiple test suites. If you’ve ever experienced waiting for a test suite taking an hour, you know how painful it can be. Every second counts in browser automation and end-to-end testing!Hard waits and timeouts are always either too short or too long. And in the worst-case scenario, the fluctating load times make the wait sometimes too long and sometimes too short, making our script fail randomly. You should avoid this situation at all cost because it will result in unpredictable, seemingly random failures, also known as test flakiness.Flakiness, a higher-than-acceptable and unpredictable failure rate, is a major problem. It is a source of noise, making the system state you are trying to test or monitor harder to understand. If your end-to-end suite includes a high rate of test flakiness, the stakeholders who routinely need to investigate failures will rapidly lose confidence in your automation setup.Your tests and automation scripts must be stable and hard waits should never appear in your end-to-end testing and monitoring scripts.\nAvoiding hard waits by relying on Playwright’s auto-waiting\nTo avoid these issues, you should forget that hard waits exist and adopt tools like Playwright, which provide auto-waiting mechanisms. Let’s revisit the previous example and use Playwright’s core functionality.\n// Playwright with built-in auto-waiting\n// `click()` waits for the element to be visible, stable, ...\nawait page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Login' }).click()\nYou’ll probably notice that the script above no longer includes a wait statement.

While locators handle dynamic content well, waitForSelector can provide more control for scenarios where elements load/re-load at different times due to many external factors.4. Exceptional Edge Cases:Locators handle most of the situations pretty well, but there are  edge cases we all find here and there  where timing issues or complex dynamic content mean that explicit waiting is necessary. If you encounter situations where locators occasionally fail due to unexplainable timing issues, adding waitForSelector can be a good  fix to ensure stability.Here is one scenario which I personally encountered where usingwaitForSelector makes real sense to me.\n# Personally Encountered Example:\n# To wait for spinner to disappear\nas one of many use cases to verify the state of an object to be attached/visible/hidden/detached from DOM before moving on to the actual test steps which works on 'other objects' once page loads or after save etc.This builds more stability in long transactional flows.like an online  order where many tabs/pages load/unload in single E2E test.I think it is important to note that waitForSelector() will throw an\nerror if the element is not found within the specified timeout.\nTherefore, it is important to choose a timeout that is long enough for\nthe element to appear, but not so long that your test becomes slow and\nunreliable.Reference:https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/2202\n# \n                                    Your Answer\nStackExchange.ready(function() {\n        var channelOptions = {\n            tags: \"\".split(\" \"),\n            id: \"1\"\n        };\n        initTagRenderer(\"\".split(\" \"), \"\".split(\" \"), channelOptions);\n        StackExchange.using(\"externalEditor\", function() {\n            // Have to fire editor after snippets, if snippets enabled\n            if (StackExchange.settings.snippets.snippetsEnabled) {\n                StackExchange.using(\"snippets\", function() {\n                    createEditor();\n                });\n            }\n            else {\n                createEditor();\n            }\n        });\n        function createEditor() {   \n            StackExchange.prepareEditor({\n                useStacksEditor: true,","scoreBonus":0.07692307692307693}]

Your Playwright scripts will be as quick as possible because Playwright will interact with elements whenever they’re ready.
You can focus on defining UI actions and the expected results instead of worrying about network calls and timings.
Other waiting mechanisms
Generally, it’s recommended to rely on Playwright’s auto-waiting and built-in web-first assertions, but if you must, here are some other waiting mechanisms.
Waiting on navigations and network conditions in Playwright
When you can’t wait for an element to appear on a page and want to explicitly wait for the network use the following.page.waitForLoadState waits until the required load state has been reached. It defaults to the page load event but can also be configured to wait for domcontentloaded or networkidle (discouraged).
// wait for a page `load` event
await page.waitForLoadState()
page.waitForURL waits until a navigation to the target URL. It also defaults to the page load event but can be configured to wait for commit, domcontentloaded or networkidle (discouraged).
// wait for the page `load` event of the `/login` URL
await page.waitForURL('**/login')
You can also wait until a request is sent or a response is received with page.waitForRequest and page.waitForResponse. These two methods are key for implementing request and response interception.
// wait for a request being made after clicking a button
const loginRequestPromise = page.waitForRequest('/login')

# When to Use waitForSelector in Playwright Despite Auto-Waiting Locators:
Using waitForSelector function is required in  certain situations to build
stability in your tests where you need to have more granular control over the waiting mechanism.
More Subtle Control Over Waiting Mechanism:
waitForSelector allows for more precise control over waiting conditions. For example, you can specify whether to wait for the element to become visible, attached to the DOM, or hidden. This level of control can be useful when you need to wait for an element to transition between specific states (e.g., loading spinners).
In contrast, locator actions will auto-wait for an element to become actionable (i.e., visible and ready for interaction), but you don't have the same level of granularity over what specific condition you're waiting for.
Waiting for Non-Actionable Elements:
Playwright locators auto-wait for elements to be ready for actions like clicking or selecting. However, sometimes you need to wait for an element's presence even when you don't need to interact with it. For example, you might need to wait for an element to appear, even if it's disabled or invisible, for checking or assertion requirements. waitForSelector allows you to wait for these elements.
Handling Page State transitions:
  While the element is correctly clicked once your wait expires and your script continues executing as planned, you are wasting time. You’ll never click the element once it’s available, but always rely on a magic number to interact with your UI. This wasted time quickly adds up when your test suite grows and you’re running multiple test suites. If you’ve ever experienced waiting for a test suite taking an hour, you know how painful it can be. Every second counts in browser automation and end-to-end testing!Hard waits and timeouts are always either too short or too long. And in the worst-case scenario, the fluctating load times make the wait sometimes too long and sometimes too short, making our script fail randomly. You should avoid this situation at all cost because it will result in unpredictable, seemingly random failures, also known as test flakiness.Flakiness, a higher-than-acceptable and unpredictable failure rate, is a major problem. It is a source of noise, making the system state you are trying to test or monitor harder to understand. If your end-to-end suite includes a high rate of test flakiness, the stakeholders who routinely need to investigate failures will rapidly lose confidence in your automation setup.Your tests and automation scripts must be stable and hard waits should never appear in your end-to-end testing and monitoring scripts.
Avoiding hard waits by relying on Playwright’s auto-waiting
To avoid these issues, you should forget that hard waits exist and adopt tools like Playwright, which provide auto-waiting mechanisms. Let’s revisit the previous example and use Playwright’s core functionality.
// Playwright with built-in auto-waiting
// `click()` waits for the element to be visible, stable, ...
await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Login' }).click()
You’ll probably notice that the script above no longer includes a wait statement. Hard waits are unnecessary in Playwright scripts because when you call a Playwright action such as click, fill or selectOption, Playwright automatically waits until a set of actionability checks pass.
Playwright’s actionability steps
Never use hard waits or timeouts.
Use auto-waiting instead.
Combine auto-waiting actions with web-first assertions to test UI state instead of implementation details.

In cases where the page is loading or reloading, using waitForSelector can ensure that the test waits for specific elements that might appear after page navigation or even re-loads based of an dynamic AJAX request. While locators handle dynamic content well, waitForSelector can provide more control for scenarios where elements load/re-load at different times due to many external factors.4. Exceptional Edge Cases:Locators handle most of the situations pretty well, but there are  edge cases we all find here and there  where timing issues or complex dynamic content mean that explicit waiting is necessary. If you encounter situations where locators occasionally fail due to unexplainable timing issues, adding waitForSelector can be a good  fix to ensure stability.Here is one scenario which I personally encountered where usingwaitForSelector makes real sense to me.
# Personally Encountered Example:
# To wait for spinner to disappear
as one of many use cases to verify the state of an object to be attached/visible/hidden/detached from DOM before moving on to the actual test steps which works on 'other objects' once page loads or after save etc.This builds more stability in long transactional flows.like an online  order where many tabs/pages load/unload in single E2E test.I think it is important to note that waitForSelector() will throw an
error if the element is not found within the specified timeout.
Therefore, it is important to choose a timeout that is long enough for
the element to appear, but not so long that your test becomes slow and
unreliable.Reference:https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/2202

# 1. Overview
In this tutorial, we’re going to understand the purpose of package-info.java and how it is useful. Simply put, package-info is a Java file that can be added to any Java package.
# 2. Purposes of package-info
The package-info.java file currently serves two purposes:
A place for package-level documentation
Home for package-level annotations
Other than the aforementioned, the use-cases can be extended as required. In the future, if it’s required to add any package-level feature, this file will be a perfect place.Let’s examine the current use cases in detail.
# 3. Package Documentation
Prior to Java version 5, the documentation related to a package was placed in an HTML file, package.html. This is just a normal HTML file with Javadoc comments placed inside the body tag.
  if (typeof window.freestar !== 'undefined' && typeof window.freestar.queue !== 'undefined') {
    freestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: "baeldung_leaderboard_mid_1", slotId: "baeldung_leaderboard_mid_1" });
    }
As JDK 5 arrived on the scene, package.html gave way to a new option, package-info.java, which is now preferred over package.html.Let’s see an example of the package documentation in a package-info.java file:/**
 * This module is about impact of the final keyword on performance

 * using the final keyword in our code. This module examines the performance
 * implications of using final on a variable, method, and class level.

package com.baeldung.finalkeyword;The above package-info.java will generate the Javadoc:So, just as we write a Javadoc in other places, we can place the package Javadoc in a Java source file.

    freestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: "baeldung_leaderboard_mid_2", slotId: "baeldung_leaderboard_mid_2" });
    }
Consider a situation where we need to declare fields, parameters, and return values as non-null by default. We can achieve this goal by simply including the @NonNullApi annotation for non-null parameters and return values, and the @NonNullFields annotation for non-null fields, in our package-info.java file.@NonNullFields and @NonNullApi will mark fields, parameters, and return values as non-null unless they are explicitly marked as @Nullable:@NonNullApi

It was introduced by Alistair Cockburn in 2005 and has since gained popularity in the software development community.At the heart of Hexagonal Architecture is the idea that the core of the application should be independent of external systems and concerns. In practice, this means that the core of the application should be designed as a set of interfaces or ports that define the behavior of the system, without any implementation details.These interfaces can then be implemented by adapters that provide specific functionality, such as interacting with a database, a user interface, or an external API. The adapters are responsible for translating between the core interfaces and the specific implementation details of the external system.To implement Hexagonal Architecture, developers typically define a set of core interfaces or ports that represent the behavior of the system. These might include interfaces for interacting with the business logic of the system, interfaces for handling user input, and interfaces for interacting with external systems.The core interfaces are then implemented by one or more adapter layers, which provide specific implementations for each interface.

# Hexagonal Architecture: 3 core principles and a practical implementation example
If you're a software developer working on a complex software system, consider using Hexagonal Architecture as your software architecture framework. This approach can help you break down your system into smaller, more manageable components, making it easier to understand and maintain over time. Additionally, by separating the core logic of the system from external components, you can make your system more adaptable and flexible, making it easier to integrate with external systems or adapt to changing business needs.The benefits of Hexagonal Architecture are clear: better separation of concerns, clean code, improved testability and maintainability, increased flexibility and adaptability, and reduced coupling and increased cohesion. By embracing these principles, you can build software systems that are more robust, maintainable, and adaptable, even as your business needs and external systems change. So don't hesitate to consider Hexagonal Architecture for your next project and see the benefits for yourself.

Hexagonal Architecture, there are always two sides to every story - Article by Pablo Martinez
Usage of this architectural pattern offers tremendous benefits for designing software systems that are testable, decoupled, flexible, and maintainable, and last but not least, this pattern helps in building software systems that are resistant in the face of technological advancements and time.
At its core, the hexagonal architecture enables reversibility of the decisions, and as Martin Fowler concluded: One of an architect’s most important tasks is to eliminate irreversibility in software design.[8]
However, the complexity involved in designing and building software products with this pattern, indirection, translation between models, and a steep learning curve for developers in terms of understanding the concepts and principles can be a deal breaker.
Going down the rabbit hole of patterns, in general, is not a good idea.
As mentioned in the introduction, each architectural pattern enables the achievement of some quality attributes, which we, as designers should identify before deciding on that particular pattern.
Identifying the right quality attributes of the system and choosing the least-worst set of trade-offs that your system can tolerate in order to be a success story, are some of the most crucial aspects of software architecture.

  What is the open closed principle?
The open-closed principle basically states that a software entity (class, module, function, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. The main idea of this principle is to keep the existing code from breaking when you implement new features.A class is:
Open if you can extend it, and produce a subclass and do whatever you want with it—add new methods or fields, override base behavior, etc.
Closed if it's 100% ready to be used by other classes—its interface is clearly defined and won’t be changed in the future.

        Error handling In Spring Boot
Hexagonal Architecture enforces security at the system's edges through rigorously defined ports and adapters. Ports act as gatekeepers, mandating validation and access control before interacting with the core logic. This design inherently discourages insecure practices, such as direct database access from the UI layer, and promotes immutability in the domain to prevent tampering. For instance, a healthcare app might use adapters to validate FHIR API inputs and enforce role-based access before patient data reaches the core.The architecture's emphasis on functional paradigms (e.g., immutable data structures, pure domain logic) further reduces vulnerabilities like side-channel attacks or unauthorized state changes.

# Real-World Journeys
Startups operate in fast-moving environments where rapid iteration is critical. Layered architecture is often the best fit for early-stage companies because it allows small teams to build and deploy MVPs quickly without complex abstractions. For example, a food delivery startup might launch its app within weeks with a simple 3-tier architecture (UI, business logic, database).

# Evolving Architectures – From MVP to Mature System
Clean Architecture's rigorous layering provides long-term maintainability for complex systems. However, it introduces excessive overhead for simpler projects, while Hexagonal Architecture offers a more balanced ports-and-adapters model that still demands discipline to maintain boundaries. In contrast, Layered Architecture's initial simplicity often degrades into tight coupling and scattered logic over time, making it suitable only for short-lived or trivial applications. The optimal choice depends on project scope, lifespan, and team capacity—with Clean excelling in enterprise environments, Hexagonal providing adaptable structure, and Layered serving only basic, transient needs.
